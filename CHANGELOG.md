## Phase 1: Ethereum Primitives

### Task 1: Hex Utilities (`Onchain.Hex`)
**Completed** | [D:3/B:9/U:8 → Eff:2.83]

**What was done:**
- Created `Onchain.Hex` with 7-function API: `decode/1`, `decode!/1`, `encode/1`, `to_integer/1`, `to_integer!/1`, `from_integer/1`, `valid?/1`
- Delegates to `Signet.Hex` with normalized error tuples: `{:error, {:invalid_hex, input}}`
- Added descripex `api()` declarations for all public functions
- Added `use Descripex.Discoverable` to root `Onchain` module for `Onchain.describe/0-2`
- `valid?/1` uses regex (not decode) to correctly reject empty strings and bare `0x` prefix
- `@dialyzer {:no_match, ...}` for Signet spec mismatch (returns `:invalid_hex`, spec says `:error`)
- 32 tests covering all functions, edge cases, roundtrips, and Signet passthrough behaviors

**Files:**
- `lib/onchain/hex.ex` (created)
- `test/onchain/hex_test.exs` (created)
- `lib/onchain.ex` (added Discoverable)
